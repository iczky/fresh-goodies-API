# Fresh Goodies API

Welcome to the Fresh Goodies API project! This backend service is designed to manage and provide data for the Fresh Goodies application, following best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and robustness.

## Features

- **Global Response Handling**: A custom response class is used for consistent and standardized responses across all endpoints.
- **Global Exception Handling**: Implemented global exception handlers to manage custom exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
- **Feature-based Project Structure**: The project is organized by features, with each package containing its own service, entity, repository, and controller to promote modularity and ease of maintenance.
- **Service Interfaces**: Services are implemented with interfaces to enhance Inversion of Control (IoC), allowing for better testability and flexibility.

## Installation

## Best Practices

1. **Global Response Class**: A unified response format for all API responses, ensuring consistency and easy parsing by the frontend.
   
2. **Global Exception Handler**: Centralized exception handling to manage errors gracefully and provide clear, informative messages.

3. **Feature-based Structure**: Each feature is self-contained within its own package, including controllers, services, entities, and repositories, promoting modular design and easier maintenance.

4. **Service Interfaces**: Services are designed with interfaces to support dependency injection, enhancing the flexibility and testability of the code.
